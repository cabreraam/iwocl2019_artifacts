This contains all of the data for sweeping the parameters for kernel version
v5.

*.txt files hold the raw output from the program for 100 execution runs.
*.csv files hold the execution times extracted from the .txt files.

The first number in the data_*.csv file titles is the BSIZE parameter for those 
runs.
The second number in the data_*.csv file titles is the PAR parameter for those
runs.
