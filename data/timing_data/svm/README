data_2048_32.txt is the raw output from the program that contains all of the
100 execution runs for running the program with explicit reads/writes. 

data_2048_32_svm_harp8_with_alloc.txt is the raw output from the program that
contains all of the 100 execution runs for running the program using the SVM
feature.

dev_write.txt holds 100 execution runs for explicit writes to device memory.

dev_read.txt holds 100 execution runs for explicit reads from device memory.

exec_time_no_alloc.txt holds 100 execution runs for execution time of the
kernel that is preceded and followed by explicit writes and reads,
respectively.

svm_exec_time.txt holds 100 execution runs for using SVM feature. This data is
collected by recording the time it takes to allocate shared memory buffers
between CPU+FPGA, as well as the execution time of the kernel.
